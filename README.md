RepoLens is a **Manifest V3 Chrome extension**. Open a GitHub, GitLab, npm, or PyPI page and click the toolbar icon. RepoLens reads the repo, runs it past the AI provider you picked, and opens a tab that leads with a straight answer: should you use this? You see the verdict before any of the README's pitch.

It also ships a **local MCP server** so your coding agent can scan repos before it installs or recommends a dependency. The agent gets structured JSON, and RepoLens opens a local HTML report in your browser so you still get the full visual verdict — not just a text blob.

> Stars tell you a project is popular. They don't tell you whether it fits your problem. RepoLens answers the question you have: should I use this, and what am I signing up for?

---

## Use RepoLens from your AI agent

Run the local MCP server, then ask Claude/Cursor/Pi/etc. to use RepoLens before adding a dependency:

```bash
# After npm publish
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... npx repolens-mcp

# From this repo today
cd mcp && npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... node server.js
```

Example prompts:

> Use RepoLens to check whether I should use `honojs/hono` for an edge API.
>
> Before installing this package, run a RepoLens scan and open the report.
>
> Generate a RepoLens deep dive for `github.com/fastify/fastify`.

MCP tools:

- `scan_repo` — fast verdict-first dependency report.
- `deep_dive` — plain-English architecture explanation with gaps/assumptions.
- `blueprint_scene` — graph-shaped architecture map.

Each tool writes a self-contained local `.html` report and opens it by default. MCP supports Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Google env keys, and `scan_repo` accepts GitHub, GitLab, npm, and PyPI inputs. See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md) for Claude Desktop config and environment options.

## What you get

A scan opens to a **verdict landing** and fans out into focused tabs:

|     | Tab                                         | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

And the Tech-Stack Builder renders its wiring on the same canvas as a **Stack Studio**. |

Plus **SKTPG** (a one-tap State / Known-pitfalls / Trajectory / Proof / Growth read), framework lenses, and capability re-tagging.

**First run:** Vee, the lens mascot, walks you through a seeded demo repo (Library, then Verdict, then Blueprint) with a short coachmark tour. After about five real scans, a second power tour shows you the cross-library tools: Ask, Corkboard, multi-select compare, Radar, and Discover.

## 🆕 What's new

Newest first — the highlights. Full, detailed notes live in the **[changelog](CHANGELOG.md)**.

### Unreleased — Actionable scans, smoother loading, provider refresh

- 🚀 **Instant scan feedback.** Clicking RepoLens opens the loading tab immediately, checks cache/provider setup in parallel, and shows a more playful staged scan loader.
- 🫀 **Long-scan heartbeat.** Slow-but-alive provider calls no longer fail at a fixed 90 seconds; RepoLens waits while the background scan is still reporting progress.
- ✨ **Smoother app feel.** Scan tabs preserve scroll, transition more softly, avoid loading-card flicker, and large Library grids scroll more cheaply.
- 🧭 **Structured scan schema.** Scans now include a mental model, risk register, adoption simulation, and learning path, with fallbacks for old results.
- ✅ **Decision-grade Verdict.** Scans now produce a best next action, confidence, evidence, and a 30-minute trial plan.
- 🎨 **DESIGN.md theme pack.** Six new CSS-only looks: Command Blue, Aubergine Trace, Emerald DB, Paperline, Toybox Red, and Gradient Aurora.
- 🫧 **Liquid Glass theme.** A CSS-only theme inspired by `liquid-dom`'s glassy WebGPU look, without adding its runtime, flags, or dependencies.
- 🔄 **Live model lists.** Gemini, OpenRouter, and Nous load their current provider catalogs in Settings, so new models and renamed slugs show up without another hand edit.
- 🧠 **Gemini Ultra-ready, stable by default.** The Google picker uses your API key to show the Gemini models your account can actually call, while fresh scans fall back to stable Gemini 2.5 unless you opt into newer IDs.
- 🔓 **Sign in with Claude.** Anthropic now supports the same Claude Code / Pi OAuth flow, while still accepting a Console API key.
- 🧭 **Safer routing and scan recovery.** Legacy saved model IDs are normalized before calls, OAuth-only providers count as connected, scans keep the MV3 worker warm, and IndexedDB blocked-upgrade hangs now surface cleanly.

### v3.1.0 — Interactive Canvas

- 🗺️ **Blueprint Canvas.** Turn a Deep Dive into a draggable, pannable architecture map with dependency-order Guided Tour.
- 🧵 **Corkboard.** Switch the Library into a saved red-string board of scanned repos and their relationships.
- 🧱 **Stack Studio.** Render Tech-Stack Builder outputs as a living wiring diagram with gaps and integrations.
- 📤 **Exports.** Save canvas views as `.excalidraw` or SVG, with arrangements preserved in backups.

### v3.0.1 — Audit hardening

A correctness, security, and tooling pass from a full code audit — fixes only, no feature changes.

- 🔒 **Hardened.** Batch-scan output is now HTML-escaped (XSS), the manifest declares an explicit CSP, and the shared escaper covers single quotes too.
- 🐞 **Squashed.** Fixed a "Compare" modal crash, made the daily **stale-repos drift alert** actually fire (it was reading the wrong field), and stopped two loaders from pulsing under reduced-motion.
- ♿ **Contrast.** Faint label text on the light themes now meets WCAG AA.
- 🧰 **Tooling.** Reconciled the version across manifest / package.json, and switched CI to `npm ci` with a blocking lint gate + a dependency audit. 733 tests green.

### v1.7.0 — Boards, Vee & a motion pass

- 🗂️ **Collections ("Boards").** Group the repos you're evaluating together and filter the Library by board — with live counts, per-card membership dots, and a one-click assignment popover. Boards travel in your library export/import.
- **Meet Vee, an optional lens mascot** that reacts to your scans: scanning, wide-open on a strong fit, narrowed on a risky one, resting on an empty library. One theme-aware SVG, reduced-motion safe. Turn it off in **Options → Interface**.
- ✨ **Subtle motion, everywhere it helps** — tactile press states, a staged tab reveal, a verdict health-bar fill, a smoother toast and modal — all respecting reduced-motion.
- 🧭 **Errors that tell you what to do** — a failed scan now offers **Open Settings** (bad key / wrong model) or **Retry** (transient), and the loading copy names the provider it's actually using.

### v1.6.0 — Claude key fallback

- 🔑 **Console API key support for Claude.** This release made the reliable `sk-ant-api…` path explicit. Current builds also support the Claude Code / Pi OAuth flow again, so you can choose sign-in or a key.
- 🆓 **Want $0?** Use **local Ollama** (no key) or **Gemini's free tier** — both already supported. See the [How models & sign-in work](website/content/docs/how-it-works.mdx) guide.

### v1.5.0 — Sign in with ChatGPT

- 🔓 **Connect OpenAI without a key** — _Sign in with ChatGPT_ uses the **same login the Codex CLI does**: approve it on OpenAI's page and RepoLens handles the rest. Joins Claude (Claude Code login) and Grok (Grok CLI login) — the three big CLI sign-ins are now all here.
- ℹ️ **Needs API access on your ChatGPT plan** to mint the key. If it's not included, RepoLens says so and you can paste an API key instead. Your ChatGPT login stays on OpenAI's site — only tokens come back, and they never leave this browser.

### v1.4.0 — Bring any model

Use almost any AI provider, not just the built-in five.

- ➕ **20+ providers built in** — OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, NVIDIA NIM, Kimi, Zhipu GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, Azure OpenAI, and more.
- 🖥️ **Run the AI locally** — use **Ollama** on your own machine, with **no key at all** (only the AI step is local; RepoLens still reads the repo page online).
- 🔌 **Any service** — a **Custom** option connects almost any other AI provider: paste the address it gives you, pick the format, done.
- ✅ **One-click tests** — _Test connection_ and _Test function_ tell you a provider really works before you rely on it.
- 🔑 Each provider keeps its **own key**, stored only in your browser — switching never loses your other setups.

### v1.3.0 — Bulk cleanup

- 🗂️ **Select multiple repos** in the Library and delete them in one confirmed action (or _Select all_). **Esc** to back out.

### v1.2.0 — Themes, done right

- 🎨 **5 new themes** — Nord, Gruvbox, Rosé Pine, Catppuccin Latte, Solarized Light. Current builds include even more, including Mono Ink and Liquid Glass.
- 💡 **Light themes fixed** — no more dark patches bleeding through; every theme now reads crisp and clear, light or dark.

### v1.1.0 — Trust & polish

- 💾 **Back up your library** — export everything (repos, connections, history) to one file and import it on any machine.
- 🔐 **Settings backup that never leaks your keys** — your preferences travel; your API keys stay put.
- 🔎 **Smarter search**, 🔁 **auto-retry** when a provider hiccups, and ♿ **accessibility** (focus rings, reduced motion) across the board.

---

## How it works

```
toolbar click
   → fetch repo metadata + README (GitHub / GitLab / npm / PyPI)
   → AI provider of your choice (with smart fallback)
   → structured analysis (verdict, evidence, risk register, learning path, …)
   → saved to your in-browser library
   → rendered as a verdict-first tab
```

No RepoLens account. No backend. Your keys, your machine.

---

## Models — your keys, your call

Bring your own provider. Five are **first-class**: **Claude** (Claude Code / Pi OAuth or Console API key), **Grok** (OAuth or key), **OpenRouter** (OAuth), **Gemini** (API key with live model list), and **Nous** (API key with live model list). They fan out across a **smart fallback chain**: RepoLens tries them in order and drops to the next if one errors, so a single key is enough to start.

**Nous** (Nous Research) **→ Gemini → OpenRouter → Grok → Anthropic**

On top of those, RepoLens works with **almost any other AI service** through one registry: **OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, NVIDIA NIM, Kimi (Moonshot), Zhipu GLM, Qwen (Aliyun), Xiaomi MiMo, Volcengine Ark, Ollama Cloud, MiniMax, Azure OpenAI**, local **Ollama** (no key needed), and a universal **Custom** endpoint. Each keeps its **own key** (switching never loses data), has a model picker, an optional **endpoint override**, and built-in **connection / function self-tests**. Gemini, OpenRouter, and Nous refresh their model pickers from the provider APIs, and every picker still has **Custom…** for a brand-new model ID. Connect just one and it works. It joins the fallback chain automatically.

> **CLI-style sign-ins.** Anthropic uses the same Claude Code / Pi OAuth flow, OpenAI offers the Codex-style **Sign in with ChatGPT**, and xAI uses the Grok device flow. If a plan does not expose API access through OAuth, paste that provider's API key instead.

> Local-only? Point at **Ollama** on `localhost`. No key, no cloud. (Spawning a local _CLI_ binary like `claude`/`codex` still isn't possible: a browser extension is sandboxed and can't launch a program. But it can do those CLIs' **OAuth logins**, and talk to a local HTTP model server like Ollama.)

Each provider has a model dropdown (★ marks the recommended pick), and you can **route each part of a scan to a different model**:

> Core scan → _Claude Opus 4.8_ for the deep judgment. Re-tag → a cheap, fast model. Deep Dive → whatever you like.

Any per-part pick still falls back to the full chain if that provider errors or isn't connected, so nothing can dead-end. Set it all in **Options → More model providers** and **Models per scan part**.

## Storage — nothing to install

Your whole library lives **in the browser** (IndexedDB). No database, no daemon, no setup. It works the moment you load the extension, and it's Web-Store-ready.

Because it's _your_ data, you can take it with you: **Library → Export** writes your whole library (analyzed repos, the semantic graph, and the local scan cache) to one portable JSON file, and **Import** restores it (merge or replace) on any machine. Backups are validated and bounded on import, so a bad file fails safe. Your settings travel too: **Options → Back up your settings** exports your theme, voice, model picks and per-part routing, but never your API keys.

Migrating from an old VelesDB server? **Options → Import from VelesDB** pulls your library across in one click.

## Install

First get the code — `git clone` the repo (or download the ZIP and unzip it). Then:

```text
chrome://extensions  →  Developer mode (top-right)  →  Load unpacked  →  select the folder
```

Then click the RepoLens icon on any repo page.

## Develop

> For contributors — if you just want to _use_ RepoLens, you're done after **Install** above.

```bash
npm install            # installs vitest + lint/format tooling
npm test               # unit tests across the pure helpers
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage  # v8 coverage for the pure modules
npm run lint           # eslint (flat config)
npm run format:check   # prettier
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the suite on every push and PR. Pure ES modules, **no build step**.

## Optional: the deeper-scan runner

For Deep Dive grounded in _measured_ facts (real file counts, languages, dependency graph, license, architecture, tests/CI, secret scan), run the companion **Rust** daemon — it downloads a repo's source and analyzes it statically (it never executes repo code). Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs); from the runner directory:

```bash
cargo run --release -- serve   # listens on localhost:9191
```

The extension auto-detects it and the Deep Dive pill turns green. Without it, Deep Dive simply falls back to the README.
