// Synergies — complementary repos that work WELL TOGETHER with the scanned one

Target repo: ${repoData.repoId}
What it is: ${repoData.eli5 || repoData.description || '—'}
Category: ${repoData.category || '?'} · Language: ${repoData.language || '?'}

Repos already in the user's saved library (prefer these where they genuinely pair):
${lib}

Identify 4–8 synergies. For each: the repo (use a library repoId when it fits, otherwise suggest a well-known complementary tool), its role/category, how it pairs with the target (the synergy — what the combination unlocks), and whether it's already in the user's library.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences:
{
  "synergies": [
    { "repoId": "owner/name or tool name", "category": "e.g. State management", "synergy": "How they pair and what the combo unlocks.", "in_library": true }
  ]
